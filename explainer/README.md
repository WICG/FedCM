# Federated Credentials Management

FedCM is an **active** exploration into how to evolve the web as a result
of the **ongoing** privacy-oriented changes in browsers (e.g.
[1](https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/),
[2](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/03/todays-firefox-blocks-third-party-tracking-cookies-and-cryptomining-by-default/)
and [3](https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/)).
FedCM attempts to **preserve** and **elevate** identity federation (e.g. OpenID,
OAuth and SAML) for a more private Web.

In order to start understanding the landscape of federation, we've started an
active exploration into the problem space, potential end states, and possible
solutions. These all serve the purpose of providing context, understanding and
a shared idea of where we _could_ go. For a more specific document on what can
be done right now, please see the
[Federated Credential Management API](https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM) proposal.

This explainer has been broken into several sections.

1. What is the [language](glossary.md) being used?
1. What's the [problem](problem.md) being solved?
   * What are some [related problems](related_problems.md)?
   * What has been tried [previously](prior.md)?
1. Description of where we [should](proposal.md) be and accompanying
   [FedCM API](https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM) proposal.
   * What [alternatives](alternatives_considered.md) have been explored?
1. Potential [roadmap](roadmap.md) to the [proposal](proposal.md).

If you'd like to contribute, see the top-level [README](../README.md) for
details.
